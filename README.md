-Recipe Website
This project is a website that features a collection of recipes. It was created with the intention of enhancing my HTML skills and serves as a platform to showcase my progress in this area.

-Features
Recipe Links: The website provides links to a curated selection of recipes.

-Technologies Used
The website is built exclusively using HTML, emphasizing a focus on mastering the fundamentals of this web development language.

-Future Plans
While the current version of the project relies solely on HTML, I have plans to incorporate additional technologies and features in future updates. These may include CSS for enhanced styling.

-Getting Started
To explore the recipe website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can navigate through the available recipe links and enjoy the culinary inspiration.
